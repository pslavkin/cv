   I've worked for Xenon S.A as a developer and manufacturer of electronic equipment for cinemas automation.\\
   The equipment is controlled by a RS232 channel using a custom protocol based on MODBUS.\\
   Models are manufactured with different performance, sizes and cabinets as shown in figure \ref{fig:xenon}.\\
