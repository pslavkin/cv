   I worked for a year at an exciting aerospace start-up as an embedded systems leader. I've developed firmware for complex SoCs, analysis of new technologies, port of bootloaders, port of embedded linux, device drivers, baremetal C and ASM startup coding, analysis of aerospace software, among other related activities. I've worked in a team with other 15 specialists, but I quit due to moving to another country.
