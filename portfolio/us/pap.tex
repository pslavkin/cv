\subsection{{CNC Machine controller}}
   \hypertarget{subsec:pap}
   As a final project for the CESE (Embedded system specialization), I've designed a complete 3 axis CNC machine controller including the firmware for the real time task and Ethernet communication on a cortex M4F, the stepper motor drives and a software for PC to send the GCode files and show the actual position of the machine on real time.\\
   The machine could be managed over the internet or run completely alone using the embedded controller.\\
   The pictures of my actual implementation are shown in the figure \ref{fig:pap} and I've upload some videos of the running machine cutting a piece of wood in the following link \href{\linkcncvideos}{videos pap}.
   On the videos list you will find my public defense of the work at the UBA university.\\
