In addition to consulting tasks, a wireless device was developed to report temperature, humidity, speed, and other parameters from the box of a cargo truck to a GSM tracking equipment.\\
I've used 0402 technology in a 4-layer PCB with radiofrequency requirements from 200 MHz to 2.4 GHz.\\
I've developed the schematic, and the PCB in Orcad Allegro as shown in the figure \ref{fig:seconsat}.\\
