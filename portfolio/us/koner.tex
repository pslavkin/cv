   I've worked for Grupo Koner as a consultant engineer, developer and manufacturer of products related to access control.\\
   I've developed from scratch a fully customized RFID reader to communicate with a GSM tracker and report the truck driver remotely and also have some alarm functions.\\
   I've made also a wireless panic button integrated with the actual design.\\
