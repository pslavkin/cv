   I begin working on the firmware for the fresh new roboot \href{https://pal-robotics.com/robots/kangaroo/}{\emph{Kangaroo}}. I study the hardware platform, main SoC capabilities and then a master plan was designed.

During my job at \href{\linkpalrobotics}{PAL Robotics} I mainly work as a bootloader firmware design and developer.
The main core is a 5x core 1xARM Cortex + 2x C2000 aqrquitecture + 2 small but fast cores with custom RISC architecture.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item{Design the main architecture of the bootloader taking in account the restricted resources}
      \item{Implement the IPC for intercores communication pattern}
      \item{Design the IPC for intercores communication}
      \item{Implement a baremetal framework with full featured CLI to interact with bootloader}
      \item{Implement a realtime time and frequency visualizer over EtherCAT and UART using matplotlib\+numpy}
      \item{Implement a persistent telemetry over EtherCAT and UART with custom json lib converter to a python -> influxDB <- Graphana}
      \item{"Three cores one code" pattern to reuse the same files for each code with minor changes related to hardware, memory layout and so, usin makefiles and #ifdef's}
   \end{itemize}
